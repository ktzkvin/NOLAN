## 🏗️ Azure-based Architecture

The NOLAN system is built entirely on Azure infrastructure, combining storage, AI, and orchestration services. Below is an overview of how components interact:

![NOLAN Architecture](./assets/NOLAN_diagram.jpg)

**Main components include:**

- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores documents, templates, embeddings
- **Azure OpenAI**: Handles all completions, answers, summarization and generation via GPT-4o mini
- **Azure AI Search**: Retrieves relevant documents from indexed HR corpuses
- **Azure SQL Database**: Stores structured employee data
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Logs chat history and operations
- **Azure Logic Apps / Functions**: Automates document workflows and intent execution
- **Azure AI Document Intelligence & Computer Vision**: Parses and OCRs uploaded HR files

---

## 🎯 Objective

> The goal is to offer HR staff a seamless AI assistant that can interpret, search, generate and verify, across all HR documentation and employee datasets, with minimal manual overhead.

---

## 📤 Output

All answers are routed back via the Streamlit frontend after being processed through the orchestrator and appropriate Azure service pipelines.

The backend (FastAPI) can also be queried independently using tools like Postman or cURL via `http://localhost:8000/docs` for testing and integration purposes.
